## How to Use

### Step 1: Prepare Your Photoshop Template

1. Create a PSD file with:
   - Background layers (your product/scene)
   - A Smart Object layer containing placeholder artwork
   - Any effects applied to the smart object (shadows, transforms, etc.)

2. Name your smart object layer clearly (e.g., "Product Smart Object")

### Step 2: Prepare Your Artwork Files

- Have your artwork ready as PNG files
- All artwork should be the same aspect ratio for best results
- Consider using similar color profiles for consistent effect application

### Step 3: Generate Mockups

1. **Launch the Application**

2. **Upload Template**:
   - Click "Select PSD Template"
   - Choose your prepared Photoshop file

3. **Enter Smart Object Name** (Optional):
   - Type the exact name of your smart object layer
   - Leave blank to auto-detect smart objects

4. **Select Artwork Files**:
   - Click "Select Artwork Files"
   - Choose one or more PNG files to use as replacements

5. **Configure Output Names** (Optional):
   - Enter custom names for each output file
   - Leave blank to use automatic naming

6. **Configure Variations** (Optional):
   - Enable variation types you want to create
   - **Distance**: Enter scale percentages (e.g., 95, 100, 105)
   - **Framing**: Enter position offsets (e.g., -20,0; 20,0)
   - **Tilt**: Enter tilt angles in degrees (e.g., -5, 0, 5)
   - **Rotation**: Enter rotation angles (e.g., -3, 0, 3)

7. **Generate Script**:
   - Click "Generate Photoshop Script"
   - Save the `.jsx` file to your computer

### Step 4: Run the Script in Photoshop

#### Method 1: File Menu
1. Open Photoshop
2. Go to File ‚Üí Scripts ‚Üí Browse...
3. Select the generated `.jsx` file
4. Follow any prompts (select which layer to replace)
5. Wait for processing to complete

#### Method 2: ExtendScript Toolkit
1. Open Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit
2. Open the generated `.jsx` file
3. Set target to Adobe Photoshop
4. Click Run

#### Method 3: Command Line (macOS)
```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "Adobe Photoshop 2025" to do javascript file "path/to/script.jsx"'
```

## Tips for Best Results

### Template Creation
- Use high-resolution templates (at least 2000px wide)
- Apply effects to the smart object layer, not the contents
- Test with one artwork file first

### Artwork Preparation
- Use consistent dimensions across all artwork
- PNG format with transparency works best
- Consider the background color of your mockup

### Troubleshooting Effects
If effects aren't applying consistently:
- Check artwork color profiles
- Ensure all artwork has similar properties (transparency, color mode)
- Verify smart object blend modes aren't color-dependent

## Common Issues

### "Smart object layer not found"
- Ensure you've typed the exact layer name
- Check for extra spaces in the layer name
- Try leaving the field blank for auto-detection

### Effects not applying
- Make sure effects are applied to the smart object layer itself
- Check if blend modes are compatible with your artwork colors
- Try with different artwork files to isolate the issue

### Script runs but no output
- Check the output folder path in the script
- Ensure Photoshop has write permissions
- Verify the template file path is correct

## Privacy & Security

- All processing happens locally on your computer
- No files are uploaded to any servers
- No internet connection required after installation
- Your designs and templates remain completely private
